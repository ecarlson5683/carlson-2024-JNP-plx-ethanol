## Overview 
This repository contains data and code used for the analyses presented in the manuscript titled "Pharmacological depletion of microglia protects from alcohol-induced corticolimbic neurodegeneration in male rats" (Carlson, Melbourne, and Nixon, in submission, *Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology*).

The RMarkdown document titled "MGD_Analyses.Rmd" includes R code to:
- Read cell count (Iba1+ for microglia or FJB+ for dying neurons) data
- Conduct two-way ANOVA on cell count data with drug (PLX5622 vs vehicle) and diet (ethanol vs control) as between-subjects factors along with pairwise comparisons of simple effects with Bonferroni correction when appropriate.
- Read data related to intoxication behavior, ethanol dose, and blood ethanol concentrations and conduct Welch t-tests.

## Dependencies
The following packages are required to run this code and can be installed using `install.packages("<package>")`:
- {tidyverse}
- {afex}
- {emmeans}
- {rstatix}

## ***data/results*** Directory
The ***data/results*** directory contains summary statistics and Welch's t-tests conducted comparing the effects of drug (PLX5622 vs vehicle) on the following ethanol binge metrics: blood ethanol concentration (bec), dose of ethanol (dose), and behavioral intoxication (intoxication) using {rstatix}. It also has the results of two-way ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons conducted on the effects of drug (PLX5622 vs vehicle) and diet (ethanol vs control) on Iba1+ (microglia) cell counts and FJB+ (dying neurons) cell counts using {rstatix}, {emmeans}, and {afex}. Finally, the percentage difference between drug treatment within diet for Iba1+ cell counts is included. These files have the following self explanatory names:
- **bec_summary.csv**
- **bec_ttest.csv**
- **dose_summary.csv**
- **dose_ttest.csv**
- **FJB_counts_hippo_aov2_posthoc.csv**
